# 👋 Hi, I'm Hugo!

I'm a former Customer Experience Manager currently transitioning into Data Analytics.  
I’m passionate about using data to make better decisions — grounded in real-world context, user needs, and operational realities.

🎯 Right now, I'm completing a full-time **Data Analytics bootcamp** at [SPICED Academy](https://www.spiced-academy.com/) in Berlin (Mar–Jun 2025), where I’m building solid foundations in:
- Python & Pandas
- SQL & Relational Databases
- Data Visualization (Tableau, matplotlib)
- Statistics & Machine Learning basics

---

## 🧠 My Background

Before pivoting into data, I led customer service teams in fast-paced startups, where I:
- Improved support processes using data insights  
- Implemented tagging systems and automated workflows  
- Collaborated closely with Product, Ops, and Data teams to drive service improvements  
- Discovered a genuine interest in analytics through my hands-on work

Now I’m combining this operational experience with technical training to become a **Data Analyst with strong real-world intuition**.
